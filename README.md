# Bank OCR

This is an implementation of the [Bank OCR Kata](http://codingdojo.org/kata/BankOCR/). It only addresses user story #1.

## Getting Started

This assumes you have a Javascript development with
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v6.11.0) and
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v3.10.10).

1. ``npm install``
2. ``npm link``

You can now run ``bankocr data/accounts.txt`` to see the program in action. Alternatively you can also run ``npm run app data/accounts.txt``.

## Tests

``npm test``

Nothing fancy, just a handful of Jest tests.
